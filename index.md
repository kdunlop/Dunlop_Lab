# Exploring Heterogeneity in Depression and Suicide

In the Dunlop Lab, we use structural and functional neuroimaging to develop biological markers of symptom variability and treatment response. Our research seeks to leverage biological and symptom heterogeneity to better understand the predictors and mechanisms underlying treatment response in depression and suicidality. A comprehensive understanding of this clinical heterogeneity may lead to individualized treatment approaches and earlier intervention for those who suffering from depression or who have a high suicide risk.
