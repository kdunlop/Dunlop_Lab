<ins>Biomarkers of Suicide Risk</ins> <br>
**Methods**: Task fMRI, Task EEG <br>
**Rationale**: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mental disorder among suicide deaths, the ninth leading cause of death in Canada. Currently, suicidal patients respond less favourably to antidepressant treatment than those without, stressing the urgent need to understand behavioural and biological factors underlying suicidality in the hopes of developing tailored treatments. We propose that one way to better understand these factors is to elucidate the neurobiological link between suicide and comorbid symptoms. In projects funded by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and in collaboration with Stanford University, we are using task-based neuroimaging to understand how specific symptoms interplay with suicide risk.
