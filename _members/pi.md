Katie received her Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience, Physiology and Bioethics, and her PhD in Medical Sciences at the University of Toronto. Her doctoral work, funded by a CIHR Vanier Scholarship, studied resting-state fMRI biomarkers and mechanisms of response to transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. She subsequently joined Conor Liston's lab at Weill Cornell Medicine as a postdoctoral fellow, funded by a CIHR Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship award, where she explored subtyping and normative modeling approaches to understand symptom heterogeneity in depression. Dr. Dunlop is an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and Scientist in the Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science at Unity Health Toronto. She also holds appointments with the Institute of Medical Science (UofT), Pharmacology and Toxicology (UofT), Collaborative Program in Neuroscience (CPIN, UofT), Collaborative Programin Neuromodulation (CRANIA, UofT), and the Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Science and Technology (iBEST, TMU). In her spare time, Katie enjoys travel, yoga, and downhill skiing.
